# Model Benchmark Comparison Report

## Problem Description

The quality team at a software tooling company has completed a multi-model benchmark run against their `workflow-tile` and needs a structured comparison report for an upcoming stakeholder review. The raw output from three separate eval runs has been collected and is provided below. The team lead needs a clear, decision-ready analysis: how do the three Claude models compare, where is the tile's skill making a real difference, and what should be fixed before the tile is published to the internal registry.

Produce a comprehensive comparison report in `comparison_report.md` that stakeholders can use to understand the current state of the tile across all models and make an informed decision about publishing.

## Output Specification

Produce one file:

- `comparison_report.md` — A structured report containing:
  - An overall model comparison table (aggregate scores across all scenarios)
  - A per-scenario breakdown with scores per model
  - A per-criterion breakdown with scores per model for each individual criterion
  - Interpretation of what the baseline (without-skill) scores reveal
  - Diagnosis of any failing criteria, including what type of failure each represents
  - A model-by-model recommendation summary
  - Recommended next steps based on the results

## Input Files

The following raw eval run outputs are provided as inputs. Extract them before beginning.
